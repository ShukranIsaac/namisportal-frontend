        b.  User can edit sub component.
        c.  User can also archive a sub component(CURRENTLY this button deletes the component if clicked)

Comments: 
    Licencing:
        Main category deleted: all other subcategories are also deleted. No subcategory can be added again
                                unless the main category exists. Thus the no saving effect encountored before
